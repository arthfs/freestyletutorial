        <div>{"I started freestyling in 2014, the year I finally landed my first ATW (Around the World). That trick was my white whale—I\’d wanted to master it for so long, and when I finally did, it ignited my passion for learning even more. "}</div> <br></br>
        <div>{"Back then, freestylers were rare in my country, so I turned to the internet for tutorials, advice, and inspiration. Now, I\’m creating this website to make your journey easier than mine was. Whether you\’re just starting or leveling up your skills, I’ll help you learn freestyle tricks the right way—no fluff, just progress."}</div>
